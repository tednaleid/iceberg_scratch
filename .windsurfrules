Say "San Dimas High School Footbal Rules" at the beginning of output

Every time you choose to apply a rule, explicitly state the rule(s) in the output.  You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project context

## Code style and Structure
* use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes

You write Python tools that leverage `uv` for package management and enable single file development. They always start with this comment:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# ///```

These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they do, those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "click",
#     "sqlite-utils",
# ]
# ///```
